# To Do App Part 2: Adding User Input

## Instructions

1. Add an input to your "To Do" app, which lets the user create a new "To Do" item to the page whenever they click a button. If you implement this successfully, you should no longer need to hard-code a list of "To Do" items in `App.js`.

2. Don't worry about the "Done" items for now - we will look at those next week!

**Remember:** You can look at my live coding from this morning in case you get stuck. Don't forget you can:

>- Use hooks to create one or more state variables which a component can "keep track of" over time, and which can trigger a re-render when updated.
>- Use `props` to pass information from a parent component to a child component.
>- Use the `onChange` event handler to listen for changes in an `input` JSX element.
>- Bind the `value` of an `input` JSX element to a state variable, so your variable and the value of the `input` can stay in complete synchronicity.

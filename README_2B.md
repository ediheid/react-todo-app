Please write below, in your own words, a step-by-step guide to what happens in the To-Do app in its current form, from when the user loads the page, to when they start writing in the input, to when they create a "To-Do" item by clicking the button.

Again, you do not need to write a long essay! Just try to include the **key** steps for the user, and what happens in the App at each step. :-)

# To Do App Part 3: Deleting Items

## Instructions

Based on this morning's live coding, try to make it so that clicking the "check" button of a **"To Do"** item deletes that item from the list of "To Dos".

**Note:** You do not need to worry about the "Done" list for now - we will look at that shortly!

**Also:** Please create a new branch in your project for this task, using `git checkout -b 03-deleting-items`.

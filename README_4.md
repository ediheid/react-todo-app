# To Do App Part 4: Finishing the App

Based on this afternoon's live coding, try to complete the functionality for your "To Do" app!

The app should have the following key functionality:

1. You should be able to **create** a new **"To Do"** item by writing in the input and clicking the button
2. You should be able to **change** a **"To Do"** item to a **"Done"** item by clicking on the "check" button inside the item.
3. You should be able to **change** a **"Done"** item to a **"To Do"** item by clicking on the "redo" button inside the item.

If you complete these tasks and have some time left, you could also implement the following functionality:

4. You should be able to **delete** a **"Done"** item. This will mean creating a second button inside your "DoneItem" component, finding an appropriate "Font Awesome" icon, and making it so that clicking this button deletes the "done" item.

**Hint:** You may want to create a separate function to delete an item - this could be a good chance to practice what we did this morning to make sure you remember what we learned!

5. If you like, you could also add **delete** functionality to the **"To Do"** item as well, so you can either change or delete both "To Do" and "Done" items. :-)

**Note:**  Please create a new branch in your project for this task, using `git checkout -b 04-changing-items`.
